 # Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
We are helping Tom with an election audit of a congressional district in Colorado. We will be finding the total amount of votes cast in the election, the amount for each candidate, as well as the amount cast in each county. We can determine the percentages of those categories to seek out which counties had the highest voter turnout and discovering who won the election. 

## Resources
### Data source: 
election_results.csv--[election_results.zip](https://github.com/RaymondLloyd/Election_Analysis/files/6253876/election_results.zip)

### Software:
-Python 3.7 6
 -Visual Studio Code 

## Results of the Election

## Challenge overview
We will be taking what we created in the PyPoll exercise (-[PyPoll.zip](https://github.com/RaymondLloyd/Election_Analysis/files/6253910/PyPoll.zip)) and restructuring the code to give us additional information regarding voter turnout for each county, percentages from the total vote count for each county, and producing the county with the highest voter turnout.

## Challenge Summary										
The code delivered helped automate the process of tallying up the votes and producing a brief summary of the results. We can modify and use this code for any election in the future by replacing just a few “key” words and variables, (like candidate names and counties/cities in a district).  By automating the process, I feel, we can generate a voting report and certify an election to be used everywhere.
